# Titanic Survival Analysis-Tableau Story

By Vivek Pandey

## Introduction
Titanic dataset contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. You can view a description of this dataset on the Kaggle website, where the data was obtained (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

"One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class."

As part of this project using attached Titanic dataset I have created Tableau story to depict survival analysis of passengers on boarded in Titanic.
