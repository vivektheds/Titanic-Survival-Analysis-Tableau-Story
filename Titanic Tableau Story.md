# Titanic Survival Analysis-Tableau Story

By Vivek Pandey


## Summary:

With titanic dataset I analyzed passengers' survival chances by creating visualization Story and different graphs in tableau.Moreover, I have investigated factors (Gender, Passenger class and Age) which made people more likely to survive using Bar graph, stacked bars, Pie charts and bubble charts.
I can conclude that class & sex was major factor which made people more likely to survive,and being a female with upper class had best chance of survival.

## Design:

Here I analyzed at one dependent variable (Survived) and three independent variables which are passenger class, gender 

and age, in addition to this I explored each factors (Gender, Passenger class and Age) on passengers' survival who were 

on boarded titanic.

For visual encoding I have used red color to show people who died and green color to show people who survived.

I have used stacked bars to explore impact of three factors (Gender, Passenger class and Age) individually on passengers 

survival, also I have used Pie chart in comparision of survival rate of male and female.
Moreover, I have used packed bubbles chart to explore two dimensions (Class and Gender) and one measure (no of 

survivals) at the same time.
In addition to this for continues variable age we have used line graph in order to investigate distribution of 

passengers' survival over the range of age.

In order to make visulazations interactive I have used filters in each dashboard to ficilitate to visualize data across 

different dimensons.
I have used tooltips to provide additional details about dimensions/measures used in graphs.
