## Summary:

With titanic dataset I analyzed passengers' survival chances by creating visualization Story and different graphs in tableau.Moreover, I have investigated factors (Gender, Passenger class and Age) which made people more likely to survive using Bar graph, stacked bars, Pie charts and bubble charts.

I can conclude that class & sex was major factor which made people more likely to survive,and being a female with upper class had best chance of survival.

## Design:

Here I analyzed at one dependent variable (Survived) and three independent variables which are passenger class, gender and age, in addition to this I explored each factors (Gender, Passenger class and Age) on passengers' survival who were on boarded titanic.

For visual encoding I have used red color to show people who died and green color to show people who survived.

I have used stacked bars to explore impact of three factors (Gender, Passenger class and Age) individually on passengers survival, also I have used Pie chart in comparision of survival rate of male and female.Moreover, I have used packed bubbles chart to explore two dimensions (Class and Gender) and one measure (no of survivals) at the same time.
In addition to this for continues variable age we have used line graph in order to investigate distribution of passengers' survival over the range of age.

In order to make visulazations interactive I have used filters in each dashboard to ficilitate to visualize data across different dimensons.
I have used tooltips to provide additional details about dimensions/measures used in graphs.


## Feedback:


I have shared the initial version of my Tableau work and received the following feedbacks and I have built the final version based on these feedbacks.

* Story background can be more attractive in order to make it more beautiful and eye catching.
* Font and story navigator box can be smaller.
* Adjust charts placement in 'Titanic survival by gender' tab of story so that chart of overall survival and chart of survival by gender should show hierarchical relationship.
* In "survival by class and Gender" story-tab gender filter is not filtering data of "class/survival/gender"side by side bars, and also there is no filter option for class.
* Chart and graph size can be smaller
* For "Survival by age" bar graph range slider would be good to use.
* Analysis of survival by age should be used in detail since age could be a bigger factor in survival rate.
* Story Conclusion can present in better way.
